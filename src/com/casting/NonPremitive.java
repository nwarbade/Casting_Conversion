	//It is a casting in which we can convert a non primitive data type into another non primitive data type provided they must have a relationship of parent and child.
	//There are 2 types of Non primitive casting:
	//	1. Up casting
	//1. Up casting: Conversion of child class reference to parent class type is called as Up casting.
	//Up casting is also called as Generalization.


	//	2. Down casting
	//Down casting: conversion of Parent class reference variable into child class is called as Down casting. In this casting we donâ€™t perform downcasting directly otherwise we get ClassCastException.
	//So we have to first perform up casting then we can perform the downcasting.
	//Down casting is also called as Specialization.

// class A & B are examples
